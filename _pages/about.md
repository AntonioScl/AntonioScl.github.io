I am a theoretical physicist working at the intersection between **statistical physics** and **deep learning**.
My current research interest revolves around neural network optimization, diffusion models, and data structure.

Currently, I work in the group of [Matthieu Wyart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YkjjioAAAAAJ&hl=en) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).
Previously, I earned a PhD in theoretical physics at [LPTMS, Universit√© Paris-Saclay](http://www.lptms.universite-paris-saclay.fr) under the supervision of [Silvio Franz](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=quhI7uQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Pierfrancesco Urbani](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=tV7pohwAAAAJ&hl=en), working on disordered and glassy systems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
